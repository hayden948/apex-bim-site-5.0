# APEX BIM Studio — Marketing Homepage

Production-ready static implementation of the **Revizto-style** APEX BIM Studio homepage
(implemented from the Claude Design handoff bundle).

## Shared assets

| File              | Purpose                                                              |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apex-rv.css`     | Core design system — light high-trust AECO SaaS, signature red, blue "intelligence" accent, Revit-UI mockups. |
| `apex-pages.css`  | Sub-page components — page hero, pricing tiers + matrix, FAQ accordion, forms, integration cards, about timeline. |
| `image-slot.js`   | Drag-and-drop image placeholder web component (for swap-in partner logos). |

All pages share one header/nav and footer, and link to each other. The nav: Product · Survey &
Layout · Integrations · Pricing · About, with a "Log in" link → `login.html` and a red
"Book a demo" CTA → `demo.html`. The footer links every page (Product, Company, Resources columns).

No build step and no dependencies — fonts load from Google Fonts.

**To view it now:** double-click `index.html` (it opens in your browser straight from disk —
the CSS, JS, and the interactive simulation all work over `file://`; only the drag-in logo
*persistence* needs a host, which doesn't affect anything on the page today).

**To put it online:** drag this whole folder onto [app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
(or connect it to Vercel / GitHub Pages). It's a plain static site, so any static host works
with zero configuration.

## Sections

Announcement bar · sticky nav · hero with **live interactive simulation** (pick equipment →
scan → generate Revit family → validate 8/8 → export field-points CSV, across Electrical &
Mechanical disciplines) · partners wall · trust stats · 4 alternating feature rows with
Revit-UI mockups · As-Built Intelligence band (red + blue duotone) · 12-tool modeling toolset
(Electrical/Mechanical tabs) · Auto-Route Conduit spotlight · proof cards · integrations
marquee · awards · final CTA · footer.

## Notes carried over from the design

- **Partner logos** (Cache Valley, Taylor, Summit, DP Electric) are original CSS wordmark
  logotypes — *stand-ins*, not the companies' trademarked marks. Replace with official logo
  files only with each company's written permission. `image-slot.js` supports dropping real
  logo files in (persists only inside the Claude Design runtime).
- Product mockups are CSS-drawn stand-ins for real Revit screenshots/photography.
- Toolset feature lists are marketing-level; confirm they match shipped capability before launch.
